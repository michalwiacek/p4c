Task at Hand - ONLY BACKEND / FULL-STACK POSITIONS
To serve the frontend, you will build the backend for that with an API.

Set up the models, controllers, and API
Database: SQLite or Postgres - please provide a seed file
Send SQS/email message on create â€” it could be just kinda mock
Validate uniqueness of Name of category and vertical across both models (if there is a category with name "TEST" then a vertical with name "TEST" can't be valid)
Bonus

Set up a oauth provider to protect the API
As you can see in the JSON folder, categories have a parent called vertical and courses have a parent called categories.

Your task is to build a simple RESTful API with Ruby / Ruby on Rails that will be consumed by external frontend applications.

Challenges you will face
Ensuring that API can be scaled and is well-tested, abstracting business logic in reusable concerns or services
